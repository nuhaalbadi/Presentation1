   <h3 id="Intro">› Introduction</h3>
   <p>eXtreme Programming (XP) is a software development life cycle and one of the most well-known agile processes. Its main focus is on providing the customer with a high quality software in the shortest time possible. Instead of delivering one final version of the software, XP delivers the software in pieces as needed by the customer allowing for more interaction with the customer and more tolerance to change. </p>
   <p>As shown in lecture 7, the name "Extreme" comes from the fact that XP takes certain software development practices and sets them to extreme levels. For example, integration testing in XP is done multiple  times a day. When a change is made, all tests should be run again, extreme testing. </p>
   <h3 id="History">› History</h3>
   <p>In March, 1969 XP was first developed and used by Kent Beck who was brought to work on a project at Daimler Chrysler. He was trying to find better ways to enhance the software development process. His ideas and methodologies were proven to be successful which later became known as "Extreme Programming"</p>
   <p>A <a href="http://c2.com/xp/HistoryOfExtremeProgramming.html"> short history </a> of XP is best summarized  as </p>

   <p> <blockquote>"Kent Beck found himself dictating practice on a project for which he had assumed some personal risk. Unsure of which to emphasize more, he chose to "turn all the knobs to ten.""</blockquote></p>
   <p>In 1999, Kent wrote a book titled "Extreme Programming Explained Embrace Change" in which he explained in detail the XP methodology. The four main dimensions that Kent based his methodology around are communication, simplicity, feedback, and courage.<br />
   </p>
   
   <p>In 2000, another book titled "Extreme Programming Installed" came out that was written by Jeffries, Anderson, and Hendrickson who participated in the Daimler Chrysler's project, C3, which describes the XP methodology and what makes it work in detail. </p>

   <p>XP is built upon a number of activities, values, and rules, each is discussed in detail below. </p>
   <h4 id="activities">› XP Activities</h4>
   <p>XP has four main activities that are implemented during the software development life cycle. </p>
   <p><strong>1. Coding</strong></p>

   <p><strong>2. Testing</strong></p>

   <h4 id="values">› XP Values</h4>
<p><strong>1. Simplicity </strong></p>
<p>Team members should always seek simplicity, but efficiency, in their all practices. In XP, they only worry about things that are needed, they should not waist their time worrying about things they might need. This helps the team stay on track and deliver faster. </p>
<p>Kent<em> says in Extreme Programming Explained</em></p>
<p> <blockquote>"XP is making a bet. It is betting that it is better to do a simple thing today and pay a little more tomorrow to change it if it needs it, than to do a more complicated thing today that may never be used anyway." </blockquote></p>
<p><strong>2. Communication </strong></p>
<p>Team members should continuously communicate with each other and with costumers. Face to face communication is a key thing in XP. Everyone is involved in the development process most importantly customers. </p>
<p><strong>3. Feedback</strong></p>
<p>In XP you should always get feedback from customers and be ready to change frequently. This is very essential in XP since you deliver a working software to the customer at the end of every iteration. The customers actually use the software and give back feedback that it is extremely helpful for next iterations. </p>
<p>XP exempts you from waiting until the end of the software development process to see whether or not the customer actually likes your software. In XP this is done starting from the early stages of the software development process. This means that you should expect change and embrace it. In XP change is easy to be done because the whole software is implemented in a way that allow changes to be made with the lowest cost possible. &nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>4. Courage </strong></p>
<p>In XP you should be courageous enough to simply "throw away" any code that you think is not good enough. Do not worry about the time you spent writing this code because simply you can start fresh tomorrow and write a better one. The "throwaway" approach in XP applies also to design. Do not worry about coming up with right design from the first time, just try whatever is in your head and see where that gets you. </p>
<p>Kent says in <em>Extreme Programming Explained </em></p>

<p><blockquote>"Maybe you have three design alternatives. So, code a day's worth of each alternative, just to see how they feel. Toss the code and start over on the most promising design." </blockquote> </p>
<p><strong>5. Respect </strong></p>
<p>Respect is highly appreciated in XP. It should be practiced by every member of the team including customers and managers. No one should feel disrespected or discouraged. Respect helps keep the spirit of the team up and thus increasing their performance. </p>
