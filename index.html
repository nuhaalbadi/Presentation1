   <p>eXtreme Programming (XP) is a software development life cycle and one of the most well-known agile processes. Its main focus is on providing the customer with a high quality software in the shortest time possible. Instead of delivering one final version of the software, XP delivers the software in pieces as needed by the customer allowing for more interaction with the customer and more tolerance to change. </p>
   <p>As shown in lecture 7, the name "Extreme" comes from the fact that XP takes certain software development practices and sets it to extreme levels. For example, testing in XP is done before coding for every single  functionality in the system. When a change is made, all tests should be run again, extreme testing. </p>
   <h3 id="History">› History</h3>
   <p>In March, 1969 XP was first developed and used by Kent Beck who was brought to work on a project at Daimler Chrysler. He was trying to find better ways to enhance the software development process. His ideas and methodologies were proven to be successful which later became known as "Extreme Programming"</p>
   <p>A <a href="http://c2.com/xp/HistoryOfExtremeProgramming.html"> short history </a> of XP is best summarized  as </p>

   <p> <blockquote> Kent Beck found himself dictating practice on a project for which he had assumed some personal risk. Unsure of which to emphasize more, he chose to "turn all the knobs to ten." </blockquote></p>
   <p>In 1999, Kent wrote a book titled "Extreme Programming Explained Embrace Change" in which he explained in detail the XP methodology. The four main dimensions that Kent based his methodology around are communication, simplicity, feedback, and courage.<br />
   </p>
   <p>Team members should continuously communicate with each other and with costumers. Team members should always seek simplicity but efficiency in their all practices. In XP you should always get feedback from customers and be ready to change frequently. In XP, courage and respect between team members and customers is highly valuable. </p>
   <p>In 2000, another book titled "Extreme Programming Installed" came out that was written by Jeffries, Anderson, and Hendrickson who participated in the Daimler Chrysler's project, C3, which describes the XP methodology and what makes it work in detail. </p>
